      <h3>Solar Power Supplying Systems</h3>
      <p>Designed and implemented solar energy systems for various applications including residential homes, gas stations, and agricultural water pumps. The photos shown are from different projects such as solar-powered pumping systems and general-purpose solar supply systems for areas without access to the electrical grid.</p>

      <h3>Industrial Control Panels</h3>
      <p>Designed and deployed various mono-phase and three-phase control panels for industrial automation systems. The images reflect panels created for different purposes such as motor control and power distribution. In addition to designing new panels, I also received and repaired damaged control panels. In many cases, I reconstructed panels entirely to restore full functionality. Below are several examples, including before-and-after repair work and different panel applications.</p>

      <h3>Pick and Place Robot</h3>
      <p>This project was completed as part of my Master's studies at RPTU Kaiserslautern during the "Master Project Lab" course. We were a group of four students who collaborated on the project and divided responsibilities among us. we designed and programmed a robotic arm for sorting objects based on shape recognition using a camera. The system identifies defective vs. good parts and controls the robot to place them in separate bins. Control logic was implemented using MATLAB and Arduino.</p>

    <h2>Problem Solving in Industry</h2>
    <div class="project">
      <h3>Emergency Fix for Olive Oil Filling Machine</h3>
      <p>In a factory with a production line for filling olive oil bottles, a critical problem arose where bottles were being filled unevenly due to conveyor movement affecting pressure-based fill levels. During a major order, I modified the PLC control panel to stop the conveyor during the filling process and added a VFD (Variable Frequency Drive) to allow the user to adjust filling speed. This solution enabled the factory to complete the order on time without losses.</p>

      <h3>Restoring Automated Stove in a Sweets Factory</h3>
      <p>An industrial stove failed to start just after large dough batches were prepared. I diagnosed and solved three critical issues: a faulty door sensor, a damaged relay, and incorrect wiring caused by user intervention. The stove was restored in time, preventing significant product loss and maintaining production continuity.</p>
